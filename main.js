    You've told me once and implied many a time that you don't want a close relationship with me or any guy right now, and
    to be perfectly honest I don't know if I'm ready for you either.<br>
    However, there is no one in the world as lovely and impressive as you, and it would be a crime to not at least give this a shot 
    regardless of our age difference which was the lamest excuse I have ever heard by the way &#128522.
    I am madly in love with you and have been for quite a while, 
    and nothing would make me happier than to take you out and treat you like the Queen you are even just once. 
    I am aware that this is possibly the least romantic way to ask someone out but here we are. 
    Should you accept this offer, I will expect very little time from you because you're busy, I'm busy, 
    and I will go broke within a month if I do. I haven't actually asked anything yet though so here's my question:<br>
    Will you go out with me sometime and let me show you how much I love you? 
    I want to talk to you in real life away from distractions and other people. 
    All of our most fun and interesting conversations have been on Messenger which is a dismal state of affairs that I want to change.<br><br>
    From your loving friend,<br>
    Liam<br><br>`

    document.getElementById("jjj").innerHTML = `--DISCLAIMER FOR LEGAL REASONS--<br>
    Although I'm not 100% sure what caused your 'bad experiences' with guys,
    the two most likely reasons I can think of are not major issues in this case (I hope).<br>
    Losing a friend - If you don't feel the same way about me I am perfectly happy to stay friends like we have been if you are<br>
    Causing me heartbreak - Like I said, you have been quite clear on this. I have taken this risk and I would take it again<br>
    If this has made me a 'bad experience' I could not be more sorry and I will do my best to make it up to you.`
